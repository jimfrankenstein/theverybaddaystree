lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    Maybe you will
    Maybe you won’t
    Maybe I did
    Probably you won’t

    Give me a sign
    Some sacred geometry
    More than the sign of the
    Six six six

    Devil you will
    Devil you won’t
    Maybe I demon
    Probably you should start to count
    One, two, three, four, five, six six six

    #### Chorus
    This is what you get when you walk through the Devil’s Door

    #### Verse 2
    It shadowy figures
    That you’re in this place
    Fallen from Grace
    An upside down face

    The south wall is open 
    The Unsound is calling
    But you keep on falling
    One, two, three, four, five, six six six

    #### Chorus
    This is what you get when you walk through the Devil’s Door
    One, two, three, four, five, six six six
