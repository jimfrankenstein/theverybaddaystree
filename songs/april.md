lyrics: |-
    She woke up on the wrong side of the bed.
    Another day, another undetermined end.
    All’s well that ends well, but the in-betweens are enough
    to make you feel that enough is enough.

    The kids won’t blame you, they know times is tough,
    and nobody will deny you’ve had it rough.
    Tie white boots over jumpsuit, bright yellow as the sun.
    Grab keys, heavy sigh, and a short walk to the van.

    April, you keep thinking that your life is in the toilet;
    well, baby, you should know it's in the sewers.

    April, keep your wits about you, April, it’s not hard.
    This King of Rats won’t stand a chance with this Turtle Force in your backyard.
    April, keep your wits about you, April, don’t be meek.
    This Green Machine will keep your jumper clean of absurdities week to week.

    It’s tough to live when your life’s an open cell,
    free to wander through your private jail.
    Through episode after episode, I only hope you learn
    some tricks to help you come out of your shell.

    April, keep your wits about you, April, you’re not dumb.
    And everyone here understands that fame is not just something that comes
    up to rescue you from a subway or an alien invasion.
    April, keep that camera rolling and I’ll tell you what I’m saying.

    Someday, maybe you can find yourself
    in another world, another series of events.
    Maybe score a cushy job as a lab assistant?
    Change lives one sequence at a time.

    But your past will always follow you, and you will stay the same.
    Maybe your jock boyfriend will make it worth it.

    Just know that you’ve got nothing left to prove,
    and dammit, there ain’t nothing you can’t do.
    It seems the world’s against you, but you’ll land on your feet.
    Now grab a slice, here’s looking at you.

    April, keep your wits about you, April, don't give up.
    Sure, you spend your days in a laser cage, but you still get your stories done.
    April, keep your wits about you, tomorrow's a brand new day.
    New origins await you, in the city by the bay.
