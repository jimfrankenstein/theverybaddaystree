lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    There is an end to your life and it's calling your name,
    and it's far more beautiful than I can explain.
    When your outside is all that remains,
    then your inside escapes from your guts and your brains.

    First, there's an ugly old corpse in the ground,
    and then there's a mess and a rattling sound
    as the bones that are in you start dancing around
    and the skeleton band begins to resound, singing,

    #### Chorus
    We're a skeleton band and we're rocking in a graveyard.
    Using bones as drumsticks, and a ribcage as a guitar.
    Come join the skeleton band!

    #### Verse 2
    You can play drums, or you can play bass,
    or you can play horn if there's lips left on your face.
    But there's just one stipulation for saving your place:
    you got a skeleton, right? So just give it some space.

    You think you're happy? You're probably not.
    Because life is a bitch, and we're all gonna rot one day.
    It's better for you if you give it a shot!
    Come join the skeleton band! Let's see what you got.

    #### Chorus
    We're a skeleton band and we're rocking in a graveyard.
    Using bones as drumsticks, and a ribcage as a guitar.
    Come join the skeleton band!
    Put a little soul in the skeleton band!

    #### Bridge
    The afterlife is a horrifying purgatory
    where you live on in the beat eternally.
    There’s no religion and there’s no truthiology,
    but you can be a skinless ghoul rock prodigy.
    You can give your spirit to the amplifier,
    and your bones will dance in the hellfire.
    Leave your soul deep down in the dirt
    and join the skeletons forevermore.

    #### Verse 3
    There is an end to your life, and it's calling your name,
    and it’s far more skeletons than we can explain.
    When your spirit is damned and aflame,
    come join the skeleton band!
