lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    She's a glimpse of my desire
    The perfect soul to stop the fire
    Ooh
    A silhouette clothed in skin
    Radiating from within
    Everything I have been longing for this,
    This temporary tease

    #### Verse 2
    Float along for the ride
    Meandering side by side
    But she's at the mouth and I'm stuck in the source
    Try to find a way downstream
    Stationary, frustrated scream
    Given a sail but I'm all out of wind

    #### Chorus
    Inundated
    Sinking fast
    Inundated
    This won't last, it won't last, it won't last
    This won't last

    #### Verse 3
    Oh, she's a glimpse of my desire
    The perfect soul to stop the fire
    But she can't extinguish a fire when she's not even there
    Flesh and blood a shadow now
    Her entrance made, she took a bow
    She hooked my dried up heart and cast me aflood

    #### Chorus
    Inundated
    Sinking fast
    Inundated
    This won't last, it won't last, it won't last
    This won't last
    She won't last
    She didn't last
    I'll be stuck here forever: Inundation
