lyrics: |-
    She's a glimpse of my desire
    The perfect soul to stop the fire
    Ooh
    A silhouette clothed in skin
    Radiating from within
    Everything I have been longing for this,
    This temporary tease

    Float along for the ride
    Meandering side by side
    But she's at the mouth and I'm stuck in the source
    Try to find a way downstream
    Stationary, frustrated scream
    Given a sail but I'm all out of wind

    Inundated
    Sinking fast
    Inundated
    This won't last, it won't last, it won't last
    This won't last

    Oh, she's a glimpse of my desire
    The perfect soul to stop the fire
    But she can't extinguish a fire when she's not even there
    Flesh and blood a shadow now
    Her entrance made, she took a bow
    She hooked my dried up heart and cast me aflood

    Inundated
    Sinking fast
    Inundated
    This won't last, it won't last, it won't last
    This won't last
    She won't last
    She didn't last
    I'll be stuck here forever: Inundation
