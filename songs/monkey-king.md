lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    Everybody wants monkeys, but the monkey cages just cost far too much to buy.
    And we all wanna be the hero, but we don’t want to admit attention is our Kryptonite.
    But if we ever win the lottery, or the monkey cages somehow drop drastically in price,
    We all know the attention monkeys bring, so where the hell will all these monkeys stay the night?

    #### Chorus 1
    Hail, hail to the Monkey King!
    Hail, hail to the Chief!
    No one will remember you, but that’s the way you wanted it to be.
    So just be free and you’ll see that everyone’s afraid of being seen.

    #### Verse 2
    Just an eon and a century ago, all you needed was some time to be alone.
    And everybody that we loved would be at home, waiting for us.
    Then a couple hundred million years went by and you decided there were too many prying eyes.
    And thus, rebelliously charged into Oblivion upon a stegosaurus.

    #### Chorus 2
    Hail, hail to the Monkey King!
    Hail, hail to the Butcher of the Dinosaurs!
    No one will remember you, but that’s the way you wanted it to be.
    So just be free, and you’ll see that everyone’s afraid of being seen.

    #### Chorus 3
    Hail, hail to the Monkey King!
    Hail, hail to the god who left us long ago!
    No one will remember you, but that’s the way we needed it to be.
    We’ll just be free and we’ll see that everyone’s alone and wants to feel
    connected to the world around them.
