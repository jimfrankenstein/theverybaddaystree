    #### Verse 1
    Woodman was a boy and he was turned into a woodman
    By a witch was turning people into woodmen, don't you see?
    Now he bears the curse of the bloodwood tree
    And He's doomed to roam this forest for all eternity
    He don't care for your cries or pleas
    He's lives to make your heart seize

    #### Verse 2
    Hold the ones you love and all the others that you don't love
    Cuz the Woodman he won't rest until the world is underneath
    For He took his oath from the harvest moon
    And he feeds the terror inside me and inside you
    Harbinger of our common doom
    He'll be at your doorstep soon

    #### Verse 3
    Woodman's door to door cuz he is selling you a Bible
    Because the Woodman knows the road is paved with gold for those who seek the truth
    Now he bears the word of the Lord to you
    And he wants to share what he learned when he first heard the good news
    That Jesus Christ is coming soon
    Just kidding, Woodman's trying to kill you
