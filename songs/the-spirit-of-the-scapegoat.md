lyrics: |-
    #### A-section
    When I turn off all the lights in this little house at night,
    Azazel, Chief of the Goat Demons comes a’lurking.
    He’s silent as the Lord and imposing as the Devil.
    He’s trying to put a little terror in my soul, but it’s not really working.
    
    Tonight, he’s standing quiet in the corner by the radiator.
    I think he’s cold, but I don’t care enough to ask him.
    “Every man, woman, and child goes to Hell,” he reminds me.
    He’s starting to become corporeal, but I know it won’t last

    #### B-section
    because the greatest trick the Devil ever pulled
    was to convince the world he doesn’t exist.
    But now he’s really lonely.
    The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled
    was to convince the world he doesn’t exist.
    But now he’s really fucking lonely, so he’s hanging out with me cuz I’m lonely too.

    #### C-section
    What’s a guy to do when the god of space and time is the Devil, and everyone seems to be on the level with it?
    At least that’s what I gather from this party in a cemetery,
    and the silence of the Lord toward the dying and the bored.
    Here's to the demons we all live with every day and to the Void.

    #### D-section
    Well, I’m not dumb and I’m not crazy, I’m just disassociated, bored, and lazy.
    And the Spirit of the Scapegoat says that’s someone else’s problem.

    And I’m not cold and I’m not jaded, I’m just improperly medicated.
    And the Spirit of the Scapegoat says that doesn’t really matter.

    And I can’t cry when people die, I guess I’m deep down dee-dee-dead inside.
    And the Spirit of the Scapegoat says that I should go and join them.
    Go kick it with the dead folk, honey.

    #### A-section
    Tonight, he ate my dog alive,
    then he resurrected my childhood dog and he ate him too.
    What’s a guy to do?
    Here’s to the silence of the Lord
    toward the dying and the bored.
    Here’s to the demons we all live with every day
    and to the void.
