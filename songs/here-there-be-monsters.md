song_name: Here There Be Monsters
song_description: Here There Be Monsters slithers in like a half-remembered nightmare from a crooked carnival, equal parts spectacle and warning. Twisted melodies sway on a tightrope above chaos, while the lyrics mutter folklore through a cracked megaphone. It’s the kind of song that feels like it’s watching you back, grinning through sharpened teeth and beckoning you just a little deeper into the woods.

lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    Welcome, dear traveler, fearful, alone
    Although welcomes are meaningless, strange, and unknown
    In this terrible place. The look on your face
    Says you’re rather put off by this desolate waste

    The mothers and kids have abandoned their homes
    For the ivy is worming its way through the bones
    Of the fathers that fought and then came to not
    At betentacled limbs. Bemoan them with hymns that say

    #### Chorus
    Here there be monsters
    And there there, my dear, we all die
    And this town is a frightening place
    So watch your step and hold your breath
    Because here there be monsters

    #### Verse 2
    In the dark of the woods, by the light of the eyes
    Of the peekers that peek and the criers that cry
    Hear the claws of the clickers that clack on the trees
    To the quickening beat of your heart and your pleas

    They'll crack in your head and they’ll crawl in your mind
    And they'll pull out the sinew and sins that they find
    Twist them around like hideous crowns
    And wear them like robes, and nobody knows why, but

    #### Chorus

    #### Verse 3
    Why are you listening still to our song
    While these monsters advance in their devilish throng
    There's one at your toes that’s beginning to eat
    While you stand there quite foolishly tapping your feet

    High tail and run for it, straight through the morning
    Yea, that is the gist of this melodic warning:
    A horrible death does await if you stay
    So run away, far away, go away, by the way…

    #### Chorus
