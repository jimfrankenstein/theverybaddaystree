lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    There’s a road we walked down I swore I’d never go down without you.
    And there’s a place in Uptown I go to when I’m thinking about you.
    Our old haunt, our one detente after the bullshit: Beer, laughs, and caffeine.
    Now I’m stumbling down Lake Street looking for your ghost in these memories.

    #### Prechorus
    On this Minnesota night,
    alone and drunk beneath the city lights,
    your transcendent memory is warming up my soul.

    #### Verse 2
    There’s a coffee shop on 26th and Lynd that we walked to.
    We spent hours there, over alcohol and caffeination, I fell for you.
    Your dark hair was curling down from a white knit cap to your shoulders.
    We made handprints in the frosted over glass as I got bolder,

    #### Prechorus
    and on that Minnesota night,
    alone and drunk beneath the city lights,
    your transcendent kiss was warming up my soul.
    And I was thinking that

    #### Chorus
    you’re the one I wanna be with,
    you’re the girl I think I wanna drag into this
    cogent argument for a life.
    Porters, lagers, coffee ales.

    #### Bridge
    Now you’re gone, and God knows it is colder than ever
    (and it’s just November).
    And all of these streets seem so empty.
    I just can’t explain it, but

    #### Prechorus
    on this Minnesota night,
    alone and drunk beneath the city lights,
    I can feel your soul and it’s warming up my bones.

    #### Chorus
    You’re the one I wanna be with,
    you’re the girl I think I wanna drag into this
    cogent argument for a life.
    Porters, lagers, coffee ales.
