lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    Someday, the dinosaurs will return someday, probably.
    Someday, the robot dogs will spring us into action.
    Someday, all these promises of past future somethings just might occur.
    For now we're waiting assured that all of these things someday.

    #### Prechorus
    And everything you've ever known will be revealed to be a holographic simulation
    of everything you ever knew, and nothing’s left to know, but all of these things, someday.

    #### Verse 2
    Someday, future space places will appear much closer that they do today.
    Someday, we'll all own a glowing laser sword... but wait no, nevermind.
    Someday, doesn't work for that, it was long ago and far away.
    I cook my food by microwave, and all of these things someday.

    #### Prechorus
    And everything you've ever known will be revealed to be a holographic simulation
    of everything you ever knew, and nothing’s left to know, but all of these things, someday.

    #### Chorus
    And we're waiting for someday to be today again.
    Everyone alive will be dust before the end.
    Before the Universe disintegrates, I just want to see one day, someday.

    #### Verse 3
    Someday, I thought we'd ride off together into the sunset.
    On hover bikes or boards or maybe hover boots.
    But now I'm all alone, and the center of this b'ritto is cold.
    This future sucks so I'll just stare off into someday.

    #### Prechorus
    And everything you've ever known will be revealed to be a holographic stimulation
    of everything you ever knew, and nothing’s left to know, but all of these things someday.

    #### Chorus
    And we're waiting for someday to be today again.
    Everyone alive will be dust before the end.
    Before the Universe disintegrates, I just want to see one day, someday.

    #### Chorus
    Cuz I'm waiting for someday to be today again.
    Begging for just one last kiss before the end.
    Before the Universe disintegrates, I just want to see one day with you, someday.
