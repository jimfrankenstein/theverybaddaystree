lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    You paint it ugly to kiss it better
    A princess in a dirty sweater
    A foolish chump
    A stupid bum
    A sorry wasted time
    Put it in a letter, sealed with piss and vinegar
    Stamp hard upon my heart and let it go

    #### Chorus
    There's no living larger than life
    because everyone is living a lie
    some die harder and some die young
    But baby no one here is leaving alive
    There is not a hope, you can stop all your praying
    I don’t think anyone is listening in
    to the chaotic emaciated ugliness of feeling like nothing

    #### Verse 2
    So paint it up ugly and put a pretty bow on it
    Cram-it down my throat for years and years
    Tell me that I'm wrong
    Stab me through the middle
    Tear me apart and prey it disappears
    All-so that my soul can let it go

    #### Chorus
    There's no living larger than life
    because everyone is living a lie
    some die harder and some die young
    But baby no one here is leaving alive
    There is not a hope, you can stop all your praying
    I don’t think anyone is listening in
    to the chaotic emaciated ugliness of feeling like nothing

    #### Chorus
    There's no living larger than life
    because everyone is living a lie
    some die harder and some die young
    But baby no one here is leaving alive
    There is no escape, you can stop all your praying
    I don’t think anyone is listening in
    to the chaotic emaciated ugliness of feeling like nothing
