    lyrics
    Submitted for the approval of The Very Bad Society,
    we call this dreadful story the Tale of the Woodman!

    Long ago, Camp Woodman was a peaceful summer haven
    for the children, but one counselor saw visions in his head.
    The counselor sold his soul to win the annual Camp Woodman Days;
    a fateful sack race later and the children all were dead.

    Go, go Woodman, go!
    Was it worth it to win the first prize?
    Run, run children, run!
    It’s the Horrible Legend of Woodman!

    The counselor’s soul was banished to the waters of Lake Woodman
    and his dead and rotting body was entombed beneath the waves.
    But with his evil, dying breath, he swore that he’d return one day,
    and now waits for the day when he will rise up from the grave!

    Go, go Woodman, go!
    It is time for the Woodman to rise!
    Run, run children, run!
    It’s the Soggy Old Legend of Woodman!

    Woodman was erected by some kids around a campfire,
    singing hymns, reciting chants to give the Woodman breath.
    Foolish children, who art thee to raise the mighty Woodman?
    Don’t you fear the splintered curses of the Evil Wooden Death?

    Woodman was descended from the Antichrist Beelzebub
    to punish all the campers who would wander off alone.
    But Little Boris found the ancient Tome, Arbor Daemonium
    and said the Blessed Chant that burned the wooden man to bone!

    Go, go Woodman, go!
    You have summoned your wooden demise!
    Run, run children, run!
    It’s the Abomination, He is Woodman!

    Go, Little Boris, go!
    In fire, the Woodman, he dies!
    Run, run children, run!
    It’s the Horrible Legend of Woodman!
