lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    I was thinking the other day:
    Why do good men die? Why do criminals get away?
    Why do they nail down a coffin lid anyway?
    Because of zombies.

    If it’s a secret, then where is the King?
    What crashed at Roswell and made it a thing?
    Why is there a French fry in my onion rings?
    Conspiracy.

    #### Verse 2
    Do you think that if I told it,
    you would have the power to control it?
    You can’t have everything; how would you hold it?
    And furthermore…

    Only scientists can tell us:
    who builds robots so rebellious?
    No use hiding, they can smell us.

    #### Verse 3
    Will the rains take our lives?
    When the flood waters come, will the wicked survives?
    Did Noah keep bees in his ark hives?
    I submit that he did.

    In the event the protagonist dies,
    who will be the hero when the villains arrive?
    The one who saves the city will get a surprise!
    You think it’s bees?

    I think it's bees.
