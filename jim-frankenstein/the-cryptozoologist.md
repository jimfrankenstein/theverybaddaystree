song_name: The Cryptozoologist
song_description: A hushed, heart-heavy folk tale plucked from the underbrush on a weathered tenor guitar. It drifts like smoke through the trees, telling the story of a man searching for something unreal—and finding something even rarer. Part campfire myth, part confession, it’s a quiet hymn for the outcasts, the seekers, and anyone who’s ever longed to be known by something stranger than themselves.

lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    Are you out there?
    Asked the cryptozoologist
    In the woods behind his trailer
    to the silence.

    What’s the point of all this
    Searching in the brush
    If what I’m looking for is something
    That’s beyond the reach of science?

    #### Chorus
    And I’ve never ever seen a single shred of evidence to tell me what I wanna know –
    There is someone out there and that I am not alone.

    #### Verse 2
    Can you hear me?
    Cried the cryptozoologist
    To the laughter of the people
    That he yearned for

    It was then he heard
    The snapping of his trap
    That had just captured up the very legendary
    Creature he’d been spurned for

    #### Pre-Chorus
    And his mind began to race with all fame that he would find
    He could almost hear the fearful cheers of the people who would get in line for his

    #### Chorus
    Cryptid carnival –
    Where everybody loves me and I’ll never be alone

    #### Bridge
    The creature gave out a blood-curdling cry
    Under matted black hair, covered in flies
    The hunter leaned in to look upon his prize
    But he knew from the glowing green eyes
    Of the creature he had searched for all his life
    That the most incredible cryptid would always be inside

    #### Verse 3
    I can’t believe
    That I have found you, cried the man
    to the beast before he
    Freed it from the snare

    I think the mystery
    Is lovelier than knowing
    What awaits us in the darkness
    That we share with one another

    And I never ever thought I’d be so close to something great and then I’d have to let it go
    Cuz if there is something out there, I don’t have to feel alone.
