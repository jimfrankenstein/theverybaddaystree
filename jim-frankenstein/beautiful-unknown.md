song_name: Beautiful Unknown
song_description: A hazy, late-night drive through the wreckage of a bad trip, where the universe warps, the music cuts out, and the only thing keeping you from floating off into the abyss is the one person who won’t let you slip. It’s a love song for the lost and found... one foot in the void, one hand in theirs.

lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    Took a trip today
    Don’t know how long we’re gone
    We put our hearts on the radio
    and we gave in to the song

    I came so close to nothing, you were all that remained,
    like a warm point of light in the dark
    your love had found me and it wrapped itself around me
    and I know I’m going home again.

    #### Chorus
    Into the Beautiful Unknown we go,
    just hold me close til the morning.
    As we drift away, I’ll take your hand,
    lead me into the night

    and to the Universe below, I know,
    I’m not myself anymore, no.
    If the sun comes up tomorrow,
    I know you’ll wait for me in the light.

    #### Verse 2
    We got back in the morning
    Don’t know how long we stayed.
    It’s so shockingly quiet
    when the music stops playing.

    When we look up to the heavens we’re not praying.
    We’re just looking for what I found in your arms.

    There’s no Heaven above us, but there’s surely a Hell below
    me if I should ever fail to tell you that I love you.

    #### Chorus
    Into the Beautiful Unknown we go,
    just don’t let go til the morning.
    As we drift away, I trust you
    —just you— take me into the night.

    With the Universe below aglow,
    I’m not myself anymore, no.
    When the sun comes up tomorrow,
    I know you’ll be waiting.
