song_description: A haunted pep talk in lo-fi drag, Spooky Song loops like a dusty cassette in the glovebox of a ghost’s car. There’s grit in the groove and weight in the words. Rhymes for the lonely, rhythms for the freaks. It's a funeral march you can dance to, with a bassline that drags its bones across the floor and a chorus that chants like a séance in your parents’ basement.


    Sad kids, weird hearts, strange rhythms. You’re not alone. Just spooky.

lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    Hard living when you don’t belong with them.
    That’s why you need a sad song with a good rhythm.
    Like a shovel in a cemetery, digging grooves for

    the souls of the people who once had bones
    before they gave up their ghosts to the sticks and the stones.
    You’re digging deeper cuz it’s hard to rise above.

    #### Prechorus
    You know, if you’re gonna stay here,
    you’re gonna have to love yourself somehow.
    And damn, that’s spooky.

    #### Chorus
    Li li li li
    Everybody’s gotta…
    Li li li li
    Everybody’s gonna be at the party on Saturday
    You gonna be all by yourself
    Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones

    #### Verse 2
    Hard breathing when you don’t believe in it.
    That’s why you let yourself freeze for a good minute
    before you open your lungs and pull in the breeze.

    There’s no one here who can tell you to leave.
    You’re a part of the smell of the rain and the wind in the trees.
    So hard to forgive and forget when there’s tightness in your chest.

    #### Prechorus
    When you know you don’t have to stay here.
    You don’t have to love yourself anymore.
    And damn, that’s spooky.

    #### Chorus
    Li li li li
    Everybody’s gotta…
    Li li li li
    Everybody’s gonna be at the party on Saturday
    You gonna be all by yourself
    Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones

    #### Chorus
    Li li li li
    Everybody’s gotta…
    Li li li li
    Everybody knows if you’re gonna stay here
    You’re gonna have to give your love sometimes
    Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones

    #### Chorus... again
    Li li li li
    Everybody’s gotta…
    Li li li li
    Everybody’s gonna be at the party on Saturday
    You never have to be all by yourself
    Spooky kids gotta spooky stick together like bones
