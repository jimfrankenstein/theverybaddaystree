lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    I saw Mothman in the sky
    He had great big wings and some deep red eyes
    And coincidentally, so did I
    I was feeling pretty rough cuz I got too high

    #### Verse 2
    Late at night one Saturday
    On the bridge I built from yesterday
    He flew with me a little way
    Then he swoop real low and I hear him say

    #### Chorus
    What did he tell me?
    I'm the Mothman
    Burn ya bridges baby

    #### Verse 3
    I saw Mothman in my sleep
    He spoke to me like a father
    Said, Son, these waters mighty deep
    And this bridge you're on look pretty weak

    #### Chorus
    What did he tell me?
    I'm the Mothman
    Big spooky lamp-lover

    #### Bridge
    I believe in the Mothman
    And he believes in me

    #### Verse 4
    I saw Mothman in the sky
    Great big wings, deep red eyes
    No one knows til the day they die
    Just where the Mothman flies
