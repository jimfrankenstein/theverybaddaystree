    #### Part 1
    Do you remember that summer that we spent out on the lake?
    We were young, and our whole family was staying with Aunt Mildred.
    Nobody really noticed her warm eyes and solemn smile,
    but I took to her quite fondly. And she showed me all around her brand new house
    that our father built upon the ashes of the old family estate
    that he had recently acquired.

    #### Part 2
    Aunt Mildred showed me how to use the oven, and I’d bake
    these little treats for all her cats and dogs, and chase them through the hallways.
    And father would light a cigarette and stand out in the tide,
    and watch the sun go down, and listen to the waves come rolling in.
    Because he didn’t like the songs that she would sing to him when it got late
    and the house smelled like tobacco.

    #### Part 3
    And they’d have buried Aunt Mildred if she hadn’t burned up
    inside the house with all her animals and her crazy little knick knacks.
    And the bones that they could find, they put inside a sealed box,
    laid to rest in the foundation of the grand, marvelous tribute of a house
    that our father built upon the ashes of the old family estate
    that he had recently acquired.

    #### Part 4
    Then came the day; I heard old Mildred singing sweetly by the water’s edge.
    So I went outside to listen while the gas flowed freely from the oven I left on.
    I watched the house go up, and I listened to our father screaming out
    as Aunt Mildred smiled out the doorway of the old family estate
    that I would soon come to acquire.
