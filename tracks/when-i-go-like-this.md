lyrics: |-
    #### Verse 1
    Socrates was just a boy when he discovered dialectics
    and aesthetics was a part of his genetics as he paved the way for modern thought.
    Why is there something at all when nothing it could also be?
    I don’t know. But it’s better than not.

    But here below the Cogito, where the ego flows into the Void,
    we argued over insidious intent and oyster shells.
    But when I made you laugh I learned what nothing can achieve
    when it just be.

    #### Chorus
    And logically it seems that it’s really gotta make you think
    when I go like this.

    #### Verse 2
    Nietzsche was just a man, yet he slayeth the tyrant god.
    And if God can’t keep itself alive, who can?
    Dante Alighieri found the Way was very scary
    and he gave up. Long before it all began,

    you sang a hymn, you made it grim, you let a little skin peek out your habit,
    and I fell into the Hell that is your
    apoca-lips against my own, I felt a little soul
    inside my bones.

    #### Chorus
    And like the pagans know, it’s really gonna due your devil
    when I go like this.

    #### Bridge
    Sometimes when we’re alone together
    I can feel the dreadful rhythm of love coming out your body
    with every beat of your heart.

    It’s pounding all the dust out of your hair
    and raining down like skin cells on your cheek.
    I freak out a little when I think about it.

    #### Chorus
    That's what I'm trying to say.
