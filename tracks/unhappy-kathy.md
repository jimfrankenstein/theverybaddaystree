song_description: |-
    The Very Bad Days present a bizarre eulogy for former Flipper star and actual dolphin Kathy, who held her breath until she died. After being abducted by humans and forced to perform on NBC, Kathy refused to remain in captivity, breaking our hearts and our notions of consciousness.

lyrics: |-
    #### A-Section
    Broken-hearted, desperate hope,
    you sank to the sandy bottom of your despair.
    And there you'll wait for now.

    Deep and dark and all but grown old,
    you're holding these joyful memories in your lungs.
    Alone as you close your eyes.

    #### B-Section
    Unhappy Kathy,
    hold your breath and sink
    down down down to the bottom.
    You've no lips with which
    to drink your wine and soothe your aching soul.

    Unhappy Kathy,
    hold your breath and sink
    down down down to the bottom.
    You've no legs with which
    to see this world and know that you are loved.

    Unhappy Kathy,
    hold your breath and sink
    down down down to the bottom.
    You've no lips with which
    to drink your wine and soothe your aching soul.

    Unhappy Kathy,
    as your breath grows thin,
    surrendering now to the hope
    that you’ll find comfort in the
    weight that lifts your heart and lets you go.

    #### C-Section
    Unhappy Kathy, you have left us all behind
    to find the joy of being weightless. Being faithless,
    you have laughed into the void.

    And I can't think of a better way to be
    than in control of your own destiny.
    You can't live any better than free.
    You can't die any better than the ghost of the waters,
    Unhappy Kathy.

    #### B-Section
    Unhappy Kathy,
    hold your breath and sink
    down down down to the bottom.
    You've no lips with which
    to drink your wine and soothe your aching soul.

    Unhappy Kathy,
    as your breath grows thin,
    surrendering now to the hope
    that you’ll find comfort in the
    weight that lifts your heart and lets you go.
